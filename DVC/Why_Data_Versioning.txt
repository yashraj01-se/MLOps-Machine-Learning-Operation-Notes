Data versioning is the practice of tracking, identifying, and reproducing specific versions of datasets over time, along with the changes that produced them.

As GIT handles the Code Versioning, DVC handles data versioning.

Which exact data was used?

When did it change?

Why did it change?

What downstream artifacts depend on it?

Data versioning ensures that any model can be traced back to the exact data state that produced it.



When we commit or tag a version of the code in Git, DVC associates that commit with a specific data state, identified by a unique content hash.
This allows us to know exactly which version of the data was used to produce a given model version.
